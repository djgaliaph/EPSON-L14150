A privacy separator function that cuts off communication between devices is enabled in the wireless router. This is a security feature to cut off communication between devices through the router. When enabled, because the printer and computer communication is cut off, they cannot be connected. Disable the privacy separator function on the wireless router, and then set the network again. See your wireless router manual for details on the setting method. Depending on the manufacturer, the privacy separator function may have a different name.</div>
